# Comments about the app:

-Simple web client for management of organizations and chargepoints in api

-All in the app.tsx, to try to meet the time limits 

-The intention with more time,will be:

    -separate the api endpoints with axios to another file
    -try to do components for better legible code 
    -design improvement, that is very simple
    -more types and interfaces, and donÂ´t use "any"
